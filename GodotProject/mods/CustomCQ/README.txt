================================================================================================================
Just want to play?
Conquest Template: J51W
Winter Offensive: ZSEKG
Night Ops: 1XVU6

Included is the full package to get you started.
The 3 folders contain the full content for Custom Conquest.

Godot Spatial Editor Scene:
This includes the tscn level for Godot. Extract the file to:
GodotProject\levels


Exported Maps:
There are instances where copying the experience may not keep the map attached.
If this happens you an use the included JSON map already exported and upload it to the portal website in the map rotation.


Portal Blocks:
When some people open the experience link they are unable to see the blocks.
If this happens you can import the included JSON of the template onto the Portal website within the block editor via the Import button.


ObjID Assignment:
200 - 226 Capture points (A must start from 200)
1100-1199 Area Trigger for Team 1 Spawn Protection
1200-1299 Area Trigger for Team 2 Spawn Protection
1300-1399 Area Trigger for Out of Bounds for Everyone
1500 - Area Trigger pushes players back like an invisible wall
901 - AI Spawner for Team 1
902 - AI Spawner for Team 2
998 - Team Switcher 1
999 - Team Switcher 2
700-749 - Repel Trigger
750-799 - Repel Target
2000-2999 - VFX
950 - End Game Fixed Camera

As map detection is not working. I have set ranges based on the flag for capturepoint vehicle spawner ObjIDs: 
A 200 = 600-609
B 201 = 610-619
C 202 = 620-629 ect


As of game version 1.1.3 Default AI (Backfill and static) will now play the objectives on Premium maps. However these will only work in server hosted and not local hosted. If you wish to use local hosted or RedSec maps I recommend setting AI to non and using the EnableAI function in the MOD to enable the custom AI in the script.

Currently Backfill bots only fill 12 slots. However using the Custom AI instead will allow you to backfill to a default of 60 if there are enough slots. This number can be increased however runs the risk of performance impact.

Notes about AI:
If you set the teams to 32v32 and you set this to 100, then 36 bots will join. 
If you set the teams to 1v1 then 98 bots will join. 
Recommended maximum 60 for server performance.

Conquest Assault Notes:
It's recommended to turn off TotalControlTicketBleed.
Conquest Assault will disable HQ with ObjID 2 as this is the default for Team 2.
Team2 custom bots will stop spawning if there are no valid positions. However Backfill/Static ignore this and deploy on disabled HQs.
If using Conquest Assault I recommend having a Spatial version without the Team 2 HQs to get around these issues or use Custom Bots.


Known Issues:
Scoreboard at the end of round may break.
Backfill/Static AI pathfinding may have issues in Redsec maps.
When hosting locally the scoreboard will break when changing team. If hosted on a server it will work correctly.
Vehicles spawn on the map and cannot be selected from the spawn menu.
AI will not drive/fly on some maps.
If bots despawn while on an objective it may not update the number of players on the capture point.
Custom bots may show more than once on the scoreboard. This is due to the pool of names rotating.
